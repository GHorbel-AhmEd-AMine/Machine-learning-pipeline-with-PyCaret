**Recreating the entire experiment without PyCaret requires more than 100 lines of code in most libraries. The library also allows you to do more advanced things, such as advanced pre-processing, ensembling, generalized stacking, and other techniques that allow you to fully customize the ML pipeline and are a must for any data scientist.**

**PyCaret is an open source, low-level library for ML with Python that allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model in minutes. Allows scientists and data analysts to perform iterative data science experiments from start to finish efficiently and allows them to reach conclusions faster because much less time is spent on programming. This library is very similar to Caret de R, but implemented in python.**
